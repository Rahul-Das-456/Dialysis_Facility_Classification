# Dialysis_Facility_Classification
This is a dataset I downloaded from https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/59mq-zhts. I used histograms to visualize the data and then I created a classification model using the star ratings of the facilities to determine if a facility was profit or non-profit.
